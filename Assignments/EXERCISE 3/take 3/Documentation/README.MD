# Brief

Upgrade the **Assignment 02** by adding the use of data coming from an external web API. For example, fetch contents (audio, images, video, text, metadata) from online archives, AI generated contents (chatGPT API), data (weather, realtime traffic data, environmental data).

### The application **must** have those requirements:

- [x] The webpage is responsive
- [x] Use a web API (you choose which one best fists for your project) to load the data and display them in the webpage
- [x] At least one multimedia file (for user feedback interactions, or content itself)
- [x] Develop a navigation system that allows the user to navigate different sections with related content and functionalities
