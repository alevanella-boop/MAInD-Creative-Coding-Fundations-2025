## ASSIGNMENT 2

## BRIEF

Choose a “mini-game” to rebuild with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The requirements are:

- The webpage should be responsive
- Choose an avatar at the beginning of the game
- Keep track of the score of the player
- Use the keyboard to control the game (indicate what are the controls in the page). You can also use buttons (mouse), but also keyboard.
- Use some multimedia files (audio, video, …)
- Implement an “automatic restart” in the game (that is not done via the refresh of the page)

#### HTML
![alt text](<DOCS/html done.jpg>)
The HTML was incredibly short and simple, as all styling and interactions are done by using first CSS and then Javascript. 
I tried to keep the structure of the game as simple as possible in order to have an easier approach on the .js
