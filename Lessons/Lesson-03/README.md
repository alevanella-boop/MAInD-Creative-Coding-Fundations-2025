# Assignement 1 - My tofu ideas


## Brief 

 Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to coustomize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

 ## add 2 screenshots of the final file

## Project description

This web application is a simple yet functional list designed for organizing tofu recipe ideas (unfortunately, I didn't feel confident enough to make it an actual recipe repository).

It is possible to add new items through a text input field and customize each entry with a unique background color using a color picker.
The option of removeing items individually was the hardest to accomplish.

The interface offers two viewing modes: a list view, and a card view that displays items as blocks. 

This mini project is supposed to show some core programming concepts, like dynamic element creation, and responsive design through media queries. 

As my first coding project ever, I hope it does.
